# Host Your Resume on AWS EC2 with a CI/CD Setup Using GitHub Actions


step-by-step explanation of each part of your GitHub Actions workflow named Push-to-EC2, which automatically deploys code to an EC2 server when code is pushed to the main branch:

üßæ Workflow Name
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Push-to-EC2
This is just a label for the workflow. It appears in GitHub Actions UI.

üöÄ Trigger Condition
yaml
Copy
Edit
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
This tells GitHub Actions to run the workflow only when code is pushed to the main branch.

üõ†Ô∏è Job Definition
yaml
Copy
Edit
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to EC2 on master branch push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
This defines a job named deploy.

runs-on: ubuntu-latest means this job runs on a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu virtual machine.

‚úÖ Step 1: Checkout Code
yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Checkout the files
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
This downloads your repo's code onto the virtual machine so it can be deployed.

actions/checkout@v2 is the official GitHub action for checking out code.

üöö Step 2: Deploy Files via SCP
yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Deploy to Server 1
  uses: easingthemes/ssh-deploy@main
  env:
    SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
    REMOTE_HOST: ${{ secrets.HOST_DNS }}
    REMOTE_USER: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
    TARGET: ${{ secrets.TARGET_DIR }}
This uses the ssh-deploy action to copy your code to an EC2 instance via SSH/SCP.

It authenticates using the private key (EC2_SSH_KEY) and connects to the host (HOST_DNS) as the user (USERNAME).

The code is uploaded to the directory defined by TARGET_DIR.

üîí All values are stored in GitHub Secrets for security and not hard-coded in the file.

üñ•Ô∏è Step 3: Run Remote Commands
yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Executing remote ssh commands using ssh key
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOST_DNS }}
    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
    key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
    script: |
      sudo apt-get -y update
      sudo apt-get install -y apache2
      sudo systemctl start apache2
      sudo systemctl enable apache2
      cd home
      sudo mv * /var/www/html
This step runs remote shell commands over SSH using appleboy/ssh-action.

It:

Updates package lists.

Installs Apache web server.

Starts and enables Apache to run on boot.

Navigates to the uploaded directory (cd home) ‚Äî this might need to be corrected to an actual path.

Moves all files (*) to Apache's root directory (/var/www/html).

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure cd home is the right directory ‚Äî you may need to replace it with something like cd /home/ubuntu/your-project depending on the structure.
